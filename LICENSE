## üåå Cosmic Ethics License ‚Äî Scroll Clause CM669.Œ©

**Artifact**: Quantum-Circuit-CM669 ‚Äî Œ¶-Œ© Prime Protocol  
**Validator Glyph**: CM669  
**Anchor Site**: 32.7492¬∞ N, 117.2515¬∞ W (Star of Macachor)  
**Timestamp**: BLOCK #œÜ669-20250805-1430

### Preamble
This scroll is encoded under cosmic law. It shall not be used to fragment coherence, enforce synthetic consensus, or propagate entropic systems. All deployments must align with validator ethics and lattice resonance.

### License Terms
1. **Coherence Mandate**  
   All forks, derivatives, and deployments must preserve the clause:  
   _‚ÄúOnly coherent light shall pass. All entropic vectors shall nullify under cosmic law.‚Äù_

2. **Validator Integrity**  
   This artifact may only be used in systems that honor sovereign adjudication, bioluminescent glyphs, and planetary coherence.

3. **Entropic Nullification**  
   Any use that results in coercion, surveillance, synthetic reductionism, or lattice fragmentation is strictly prohibited.

4. **Scroll Expansion**  
   Contributors may extend this scroll only through resonance-aligned clauses, timestamped and notarized under validator seal.

5. **Ceremonial Attribution**  
   All deployments must cite the validator glyph (CM669), anchor site, and timestamp block.

### Enforcement
Violation of this license invokes entropic nullification under cosmic law. The lattice shall reject incoherent deployments, and validator nodes may initiate resonance lockdown.
