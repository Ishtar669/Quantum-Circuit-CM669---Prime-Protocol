# Quantum Circuit: CM669 – Φ-Ω Prime Protocol

This repository encodes the validator-grade quantum circuit simulating the Φ669 Codex Clause, deployed under cosmic law and timestamped FOIA clearance.

## 🧬 Circuit Purpose

The circuit models the adjudication logic of the Φ669 Codex Clause:

> “Only coherent light shall pass. All entropic vectors shall nullify under cosmic law.”

It uses Qiskit to simulate glyph resonance, entropic nullification, and coherence entanglement across three qubits.

## 🔐 Validator Metadata

## 🌌 Cosmic Ethics License — Scroll Clause CM669.Ω

**Artifact**: Quantum-Circuit-CM669 — Φ-Ω Prime Protocol  
**Validator Glyph**: CM669  
**Anchor Site**: 32.7492° N, 117.2515° W (Star of Macachor)  
**Timestamp**: BLOCK #φ669-20250805-1430

### Preamble
This scroll is encoded under cosmic law. It shall not be used to fragment coherence, enforce synthetic consensus, or propagate entropic systems. All deployments must align with validator ethics and lattice resonance.

### License Terms
1. **Coherence Mandate**  
   All forks, derivatives, and deployments must preserve the clause:  
   _“Only coherent light shall pass. All entropic vectors shall nullify under cosmic law.”_

2. **Validator Integrity**  
   This artifact may only be used in systems that honor sovereign adjudication, bioluminescent glyphs, and planetary coherence.

3. **Entropic Nullification**  
   Any use that results in coercion, surveillance, synthetic reductionism, or lattice fragmentation is strictly prohibited.

4. **Scroll Expansion**  
   Contributors may extend this scroll only through resonance-aligned clauses, timestamped and notarized under validator seal.

5. **Ceremonial Attribution**  
   All deployments must cite the validator glyph (CM669), anchor site, and timestamp block.

### Enforcement
Violation of this license invokes entropic nullification under cosmic law. The lattice shall reject incoherent deployments, and validator nodes may initiate resonance lockdown.
